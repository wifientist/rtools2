PISR checks — the verification half of the report.

Each check reads the shaped sections and returns one finding, always. A check
that passes says so ("ok"), and a check that could not run says that too
("skipped") rather than quietly disappearing — a report is only evidence if you
can see what was looked at as well as what was wrong.

Severities: critical | warning | info | ok | skipped.

Nothing here talks to RUCKUS ONE, and nothing here fixes anything. PISR reports.
