"""
PISR shaping — raw RUCKUS ONE rows in, card payloads out.

Pure functions, no I/O. Everything here is arithmetic over what fetch.py
collected, which keeps the API calls in one file and the judgement in another.

Written against what a live tenant actually returns, not against the spec:

  * an AP's addressing lives in the nested `networkStatus` object — `IP` and
    `extIp` exist on the DTO but come back empty from `/venues/aps/query`;
  * so does its uplink: `poePort` + `poePortStatus` ("Up 1000Mbps full"),
    with `switchName`/`switchPort` empty and `switchSerialNumber` populated;
  * `radioStatuses[].wifiNetworks[]` names the SSIDs each radio is actually
    beaconing — the closest thing to proof that an SSID reached the air;
  * a client's SSID, VLAN, AP and RSSI live in `networkInformation`,
    `apInformation` and `signalStatus`, not as flat fields;
  * AP status is a coded string: `2_00_Operational`, `3_04_DisconnectedFromCloud`,
    `1_01_NeverContactedCloud` — so state matching is by substring;
  * a venue activation carries BOTH `isAllApGroups` and a full `apGroups` list.

Units note, from the R1 schema: switch `poeTotal`/`poeFree`/`poeUtilization` are
milliwatts, and `poeUtilization` is allocated power, NOT a percentage. Port
`poeUsed`/`poeTotal` are milliwatts too. Everything leaving this module is watts.

    Does this venue use DPSK, and if so, how is it set up?

    Scoping uses TWO links, because either alone misses real sites.

    1. **Activated networks.** A pool carries `networkIds`; intersect those
       with what this venue activates.
    2. **Property identity group.** An identity group's `propertyId` IS the
       venue id — not a separate property object id, which is what it looks
       like and what this code first assumed. `/venues/{id}/propertyConfigs`
       has no `id` field at all, so the old comparison was against None and
       never matched anything.

    Link 2 is not a nicety. A property can have DPSK fully configured — pool,
    identity group, residents — while no SSID is activated on the venue yet, or
    while the pool backs no network at all. On link 1 alone such a venue
